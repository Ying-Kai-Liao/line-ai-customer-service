## Git Rules

- Never push directly to `main` branch
- Always create a feature branch for changes
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-auth`, `fix/webhook-error`)

## PR Merge Rules

- **Always ask for user confirmation before merging any PR**
- Once the user agrees to merge a specific PR, that PR can be merged without asking again
- This applies to `gh pr merge` commands
